\ vi: ft=workflowish:nospell:
\ this is a list of to-do items for workflowish development
* make this plugin fully compatible with vim-stay
  * e.g. on reload, we should get the exact same set of open folds, as well as the correct horizontal scroll
* emulate WorkFlowy's sidebar
  * second view of the same file to look at just the headings
    * using the focus mapping in the sidebar creates the focus folds in the main window instead
  * add a symbol to represent "starred" headings, populate the loclist with starred headings automatically
* @bmundt6 upload ~/.vim/after files as reference for customization
